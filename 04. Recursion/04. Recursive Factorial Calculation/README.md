You are given a positive integer `N`.  
Your task is to find and return the **factorial** of `N` using a **recursive approach**.

### Example 1
Input:  
N = 5  

Output:  
120  

**Explanation:**  
The factorial of 5 is:  
5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

### Example 2
Input:  
N = 4  

Output:  
24  

**Explanation:**  
The factorial of 4 is:  
4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24

### Your Task
Complete the provided function `recursionFactorial()` that takes an integer `N` as input and returns its factorial using recursion.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 15  

### Input Format
- An integer `N` representing the number for which the factorial needs to be calculated.

### Output Format
- Output a single integer representing the factorial of `N`.
