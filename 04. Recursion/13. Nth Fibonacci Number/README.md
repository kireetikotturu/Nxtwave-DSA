You are given a positive integer `N`.  
Your task is to find the **Nth Fibonacci number** using recursion.

### Note
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with `0` and `1`.

Fibonacci sequence:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...

### Example 1
Input:  
N = 6  

Output:  
8  

**Explanation:**  
The Fibonacci sequence is:  
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8  

So, the 6th Fibonacci number is `8`.

### Example 2
Input:  
N = 2  

Output:  
1  

**Explanation:**  
The Fibonacci sequence is:  
0, 1, 1  

So, the 2nd Fibonacci number is `1`.

### Your Task
Complete the function `fibNum()` that takes an integer `N` as input and returns the Nth Fibonacci number.

### Constraints
- 0 ≤ N ≤ 35  

### Input Format
- The input contains a single integer `N`.

### Output Format
- Output is a single integer representing the Nth Fibonacci number.
