# Factorial Sequence using Recursion

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Time Complexity:** O(N)  
**Space Complexity:** O(N)  

---

You're given a positive integer `n`.  
Your task is to generate the **sequence of factorials from 1! to n!** using **recursion**.

The function should return a list containing all factorial values up to `n`.

### Example 1
Input:  
n = 4  

Output:  
[1, 2, 6, 24]  

**Explanation:**  
1! = 1  
2! = 2  
3! = 6  
4! = 24  

### Example 2
Input:  
n = 6  

Output:  
[1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720]  

**Explanation:**  
The factorial sequence up to 6! is generated recursively.

### Your Task
Complete the function `factorialSequence()` that takes an integer `n` as an argument and returns a list of factorial values from `1!` to `n!`.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 20  

### Input Format
- The input consists of a single integer `n`.

### Output Format
- Output is a list of `n` integers representing factorials from `1!` to `n!`.
