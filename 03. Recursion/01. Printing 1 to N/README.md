# Printing 1 to N

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Time Complexity:** O(N)  
**Space Complexity:** O(N)  

---

You are given a positive integer `N`.  
Your task is to print the numbers from `1` to `N` in ascending order using a **recursive function**.

### Example 1
Input:  
N = 4  

Output:  
1  
2  
3  
4  

**Explanation:**  
For the given `N = 4`, the numbers are printed in ascending order from `1` to `4`.

### Example 2
Input:  
N = 8  

Output:  
1  
2  
3  
4  
5  
6  
7  
8  

**Explanation:**  
For the given `N = 8`, the numbers are printed in ascending order from `1` to `8`.

### Your Task
Complete the function `print1toNInAscendingOrder()` that prints the numbers from `1` to `N` using recursion.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 100  

### Input Format
- A single integer `N` representing the upper limit of the numbers to be printed.

### Output Format
- The output consists of the numbers from `1` to `N`, each printed on a new line.
