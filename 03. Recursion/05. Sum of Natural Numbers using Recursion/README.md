# Sum of Natural Numbers using Recursion

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Time Complexity:** O(N)  
**Space Complexity:** O(N)  

---

You are given a positive integer `N`.  
Your task is to find the **sum of all natural numbers from 1 to N** using **recursion**.

### Example 1
Input:  
N = 4  

Output:  
10  

**Explanation:**  
The sum of natural numbers from 1 to 4 is:  
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10

### Example 2
Input:  
N = 8  

Output:  
36  

**Explanation:**  
The sum of natural numbers from 1 to 8 is:  
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 36

### Your Task
Complete the provided function `recursionSum()` that takes an integer `N` as input and returns the sum of natural numbers from `1` to `N` using recursion.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 100  

### Input Format
- An integer `N` representing the upper limit of the natural numbers.

### Output Format
- Output a single integer representing the sum of natural numbers from `1` to `N`.
