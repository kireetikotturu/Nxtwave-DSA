# Printing Divisors of an Integer in Ascending Order

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Time Complexity:** O(√N)  
**Space Complexity:** O(√N)  

---

You are given an integer `N`, and your task is to find all its divisors and return them in ascending order.

### Example 1
Input:  
N = 25  

Output:  
1 5 25  

**Explanation:**  
The given number `25` is divisible by `1`, `5`, and `25`.

### Example 2
Input:  
N = 13  

Output:  
1 13  

**Explanation:**  
As `13` is a prime number, it has only two divisors: `1` and the number itself.

### Your Task
Implement the function `printDivisors()` which takes an integer `N` as its argument and returns all the divisors of `N` in ascending order.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁶  

### Input Format
- An integer `N` on a single line, representing the number for which you want to find divisors.

### Output Format
- Space-separated integers representing the divisors of `N` in ascending order.
