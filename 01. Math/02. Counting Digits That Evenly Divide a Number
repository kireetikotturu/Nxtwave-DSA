# Counting Digits That Evenly Divide a Number

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Time Complexity:** O(log₁₀N)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)  

---

You are given an integer `N`.  
Your task is to count how many of its digits can divide `N` completely without any remainder.

### Example 1
Input:  
N = 12  

Output:  
2  

**Explanation:**  
Both `1` and `2` can evenly divide `12`.

### Example 2
Input:  
N = 23  

Output:  
0  

**Explanation:**  
Neither `2` nor `3` can evenly divide `23`.

### Your Task
Implement the function `evenlyDivides()` which takes an integer `N` as its argument and returns the count of digits in `N` that evenly divide `N`.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁵  

### Input Format
- The input consists of a single integer `N`.

### Output Format
- Print a single integer representing the count of digits in `N` that evenly divide `N`.
