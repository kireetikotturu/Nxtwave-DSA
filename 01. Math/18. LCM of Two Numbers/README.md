You are given two integers `A` and `B`.  
Your task is to find the **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** of the two numbers.

### Example 1
Input:  
A = 4, B = 6  

Output:  
12  

**Explanation:**  
The LCM of `4` and `6` is `12`.

### Example 2
Input:  
A = 15, B = 20  

Output:  
60  

**Explanation:**  
The LCM of `15` and `20` is `60`.

### Your Task
Complete the function `lcm()` that takes two integers `A` and `B` as arguments and returns their least common multiple.

### Constraints
- 1 < A, B ≤ 10⁴  

### Input Format
- Input is a single line consisting of two integers `A` and `B`.

### Output Format
- Output is a single integer representing the LCM of `A` and `B`.
