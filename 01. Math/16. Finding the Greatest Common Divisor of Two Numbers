# Finding the Greatest Common Divisor of Two Numbers

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Time Complexity:** O(log(min(A, B)))  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)  

---

You are given two positive integers `A` and `B`.  
Your task is to find their **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**.

### Example 1
Input:  
A = 3, B = 6  

Output:  
3  

**Explanation:**  
The GCD of `3` and `6` is `3`.

### Example 2
Input:  
A = 1, B = 1  

Output:  
1  

**Explanation:**  
The GCD of `1` and `1` is `1`.

### Your Task
Write a function `gcd()` that takes two positive integers `A` and `B` and returns their greatest common divisor.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 10⁹  

### Input Format
- The input consists of a single line containing two space-separated integers `A` and `B`.

### Output Format
- Output a single integer representing the GCD of `A` and `B`.
