# Sum of Divisors

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Time Complexity:** O(√N)  
**Space Complexity:** O(√N)  

---

You are given an integer `num`.  
Your task is to return the **sum of all divisors** of the number (including the number itself).

### Example 1
Input:  
num = 4  

Output:  
7  

**Explanation:**  
The divisors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4.  
Sum = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.

### Example 2
Input:  
num = 16  

Output:  
31  

**Explanation:**  
The divisors of 16 are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16.  
Sum = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31.

### Your Task
Complete the function `sumOfDivisors()` that takes an integer `num` as an argument and returns the sum of all its divisors.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ num ≤ 10⁹  

### Input Format
- Input is a single line consisting of an integer `num`.

### Output Format
- Output is a single integer representing the sum of all divisors of `num`.
