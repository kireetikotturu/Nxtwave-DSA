You are given an integer `N`.  
Your task is to determine whether `N` is a palindromic number or not.

### Note
A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backward.

### Example 1
Input:  
N = 555  

Output:  
Yes  

**Explanation:**  
The number `555` is a palindrome because it reads the same backward as forward.

### Example 2
Input:  
N = 123  

Output:  
No  

**Explanation:**  
The number `123` is not a palindrome because it reads differently backward than forward.

### Your Task
Complete the function `isPalindrome(n)`, which takes an integer `N` as its argument.  
The function should check whether `N` is a palindrome:  
- If `N` is a palindrome, return `True`.  
- If `N` is not a palindrome, return `False`.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁹  

### Input Format
- The input consists of a single integer `N`.

### Output Format
- The output represents `True` if the given integer `N` is a palindrome; otherwise, `False`.
