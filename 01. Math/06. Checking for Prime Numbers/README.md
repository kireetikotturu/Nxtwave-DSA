# Checking for Prime Numbers

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Time Complexity:** O(√N)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)  

---

You are given an integer `N`.  
Your task is to determine whether `N` is a prime number.

### Note
A prime number is a number that is divisible only by `1` and itself.

### Example 1
Input:  
N = 5  

Output:  
true  

**Explanation:**  
The number `5` is a prime number because it has only two divisors: `1` and `5`.

### Example 2
Input:  
N = 25  

Output:  
false  

**Explanation:**  
The number `25` is not a prime number because it has more than two divisors (`1`, `5`, and `25`).

### Your Task
Complete the function `isPrime()` which takes an integer `N` as input and returns `true` if `N` is a prime number, otherwise returns `false`.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁹  

### Input Format
- The input consists of a single integer `N`.

### Output Format
- Output `true` if `N` is a prime number, otherwise `false`.
