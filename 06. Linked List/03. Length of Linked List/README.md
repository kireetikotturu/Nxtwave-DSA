You are given a **singly linked list**.  
Your task is to **find and return the length of the linked list**.

The length of a linked list is defined as the **total number of nodes** present in the list.

---

### Example 1
Input:  
Linked List:  
1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5  

Output:  
5  

**Explanation:**  
The linked list contains **5 nodes**, so the length is 5.

---

### Example 2
Input:  
Linked List:  
10 → 20 → 30 → 40 → 50 → 60 → 70  

Output:  
7  

**Explanation:**  
The linked list contains **7 nodes**, so the length is 7.

---

### Your Task
Complete the function `lengthofLL()` that takes:
- `head`: pointer to the head of the linked list  

The function should **return the total number of nodes** in the linked list.

---

### Constraints
- 0 ≤ n ≤ 4000  
- 1 ≤ data ≤ 1000  

---

### Input Format
- First line contains an integer `n`, the number of nodes  
- Second line contains `n` space-separated integers representing node values  

---

### Output Format
- Output a single integer representing the length of the linked list
