You are given an array of integers `arr` with size `n`.  
Your task is to return the second smallest element in the array.

### Note
The second smallest element is the integer with the second smallest numerical value among all elements in the array.

### Example 1
Input:  
n = 5  
arr = [4, 2, 9, 7, 5]  

Output:  
4  

**Explanation:**  
The second smallest element in the given array is 4.

### Example 2
Input:  
n = 5  
arr = [2, 3, 3, 2, 1]  

Output:  
2  

**Explanation:**  
The second smallest element in the given array is 2.

### Your Task
Complete the provided `secondSmallestElement` function that takes an integer `n` and an array of integers `arr` as arguments and returns the second smallest element in the array.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10³  
- 0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10³  

### Input Format
- The first line of input contains an integer `n`.  
- The second line of input contains `n` space-separated integers.

### Output Format
- The output represents an integer value that indicates the second smallest element in the input array.
